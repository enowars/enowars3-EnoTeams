            <p>The internet is a vast space where you can find many wonderful things. How about a vacation at a beautiful resort? Here's how you get there:</p>
            <h4>Network IPs</h4>
            <p>The translation formula from team-id to IP is:<br>
                TeamIp(X): X -> 10. ( X // 256 ) . ( X % 256 ) .1
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>10.0.1.1</strong> team1.enowars.com</li>
                    <li><strong>10.0.2.1</strong> team2.enowars.com</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                    <li><strong>10.1.255.1</strong> team511.enowars.com</li>
                    <li><strong>10.2.0.1</strong> team512.enowars.com</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Some important IPs that you might need:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>10.0.0.2:1337</strong> - The Flagbot where you can submit flags to on port <strong>1337</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>10.0.0.1</strong> - The game Router you will use for routing.</li>
                    <li><strong>10.0.0.2:80</strong> - The current score for every team participating the ctf</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <!--h4>Routing</h4>
            <p>
                We will only route the <strong>fd00:1337::/32</strong> within our game (VPN) network. No public connections over our game router will be possible.
            </p-->
            <h4>VPN</h4>
            <p>
                The whole competition will take place within a VPN. It will be based on OpenVPN 2.4. and use IPv4 to connect to our OpenVPN instances. 
                You can download your team's VPN configuration after signing up on this website. 

                Keep in mind that the traffic between teams will only be possible after the first hour of the competition has passed. 
                Also, services will only be installable once the CTF has started.
                If you would like to test your network, you can always ???.
