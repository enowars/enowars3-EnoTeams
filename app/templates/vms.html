                <h1>Get around the resort.</h1>
                    The resort is marvellous! Come and take at tour at the different places that can be discovered here. We call these places VMs. 
                    No questions, please. Here, we want to introduce you to the Vulnbox VM.
                <h2>Vulnbox</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the most important VM on which your part of the game will take place. You'll get a bunch of
                    services that you need to defend and find security vulnerabilities to attack other teams. You can find
                    the IP address of your team on the <a href="/network.html"> network tab</a>.
                    The Vulnbox can bei either <strong> hosted by yourself </strong> or <strong> provided to you by us</strong>. 
                    See the instructions below for further details.
                </p>

                <h3>Vulnbox - Service Interaction</h3>
                <p>
                    The services run in their own docker container and are started via docker-compose. We have also included a systemd 
                    file for docker that lets you monitor and control the services. You can use systemctl to start/stop/restart/inspect 
                    a given service respectively:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>systemctl {start|stop|restart|status} dc@servicename</code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In order to inspect logs you can use journalctl like this:
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>journalctl -u servicename</code>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Vulnbox provisioning</h3>
                <h4>Relax and let us do the job</h4>
                    Lay down on one of our nice pool loungers and put your feet up, we will take care of setting everything up for you. As soon as the 
                    game starts, we will have a nice and ready machine at your disposal, it will be all yours. Everything will be connected and ready to exploit.
                    
                <h4>Bring your own</h4>
                    You don't trust us? You think you can do better than we do? Then feel free to bring your own Gear. <br>
                    We will announce how to install all necessary components on your own machine soon.
                
                <h2>Bridging the network</h2>
                <p>
                    If you want to provide internet access to other systems than the testvm and vulnbox, then you most
                    likely want to bridge it to another real interface. This is not required to play the CTF, but might
                    make things easier for you. <strong>WE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS</strong>, so please fix bugs and errors yourself.
<br>
                    NOTE: You most likely need a 2nd interface on the host system for that.

                    First, shutdown the VMs:
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>VBoxManage shutdown teamrouter
                        VBoxManage shutdown teamtestvm
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>Then configure a bridged adapter and restart the VMs and rerun the configuration (replace eth0 with
                    your host ethernet)</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>VBoxManage modifyvm "teamrouter" --nic2 bridged --nictype2 virtio --bridgeadapter2 eth0
                        VBoxManage modifyvm "teamtestvm" --nic2 bridged --nictype2 virtio --bridgeadapter2 eth0

                        VBoxManage startvm "teamrouter" --type headless
                        VBoxManage startvm "teamtestvm" --type headless

                        root@teamrouter:~# network-setup 20 enp0s8 eth0
                        root@teamtestvm:~# network-setup 20 enp0s8 eth0
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now you should be able to connect other systems to the 2nd ethernet device (eth0). <br>
                    On your other systems give an IP6 address and configure the route.
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>sudo ip a a fd00:1337:1::IP/48 dev eth0
                        sudo ip -6 r a fd00:1337::/32 via fd00:1337:1::1 dev eth0
                    </code>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

    </div>
